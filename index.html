Stephen Spalding first encountered the joys of distributed systems while
writing multi-player games for the TI-83 in 8th grade math class. After
earning Masterâ€™s degrees in electrical engineering and image processing
from GA Tech and ENSEEIHT respectively, Stephen dabbled in medical imaging
algorithms for GE Healthcare in Versailles before pivoting to nuclear control
systems for the Tennessee Valley Authority. His CRDT journey began upon
joining the engineering team at OpenTable. Stephen now distributes systems
at Netflix as a Senior Software Engineer and he occasionally finger paints.
